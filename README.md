# Superstore-Analysis-Report
# Introduction
As part of assessment in the Data Analytics class organized by PSP Analytics, one of the analytics projects I’ll be working on is the Superstore Dataset. This superstore is located in the United States of America and they sell Furniture, Office Supplies and Technology products. The superstore dataset contains the Order ID,	Order Date,	Ship Date,	Ship Mode,	Customer ID,	Customer Name and other data of the Super Store. The goal of this work is to analyze the Superstore’s performance and to uncover insights to be used for the business growth.

 # Data Sourcing
This dataset used in this work is gotten from the Data Analytics Class announcement channel, which was posted by Mr. Kingsley Adisa.

# Data Preparation
I will load the dataset in excel format into powerbi. If data is clean, I can just load it directly or transform it to clean it on PowerBi.

# Data Cleaning/Transformation
Here, I check if the format of each column is correct and correct it were necessary. I also address inconsistencies in the columns to ensure a more accurate dataset for analysis

Now, I format the Sales, Profit and Discount columns to display currency

# Data Exploration/Visualization
This is where I answered specific business questions for sale performance analysis using charts and tiles. Some of these questions include:

1. Sales Amount by Categories
2. Sales by Region
3. Sales Amount by Sub-Categories by Region
4. Profit by Categories
5. Year with more Sales

# KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPI)
Before going ahead to answer the question, I first need to specify the KPI (Key Performance Indicators). The KPI include the Sales, Quantity, Profit, and Discount. This is done by creating measures and using DAX to calculate the total sales, profit, quantity, and discount

1. Sales: I use SUM function to get total sales

2. Quantity: SUM of quantity in the dataset

3. Profit: SUM of profit in the data set

4. Discount: SUM of total discount in the dataset

I used the KPI tile to visualize my KPI. i could also use the Card tile.

# Conclusion
So far, I’ve been able to analyze the superstore dataset and to draw valuable insights through the business questions. Based on these findings, i can be able to provide data-driven recommendations to help for business growth. The resulting dashboard built from powerbi is shown below:
